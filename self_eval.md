# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

The notes and files show that you can use : or => to instantiate hashes,
but only : would work for me.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I have not been taking extensive notes; this could prove fatal later. Tricky syntax
will be worth notating.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I try to solve it on my own with the resources from the lesson. If there is something that
the lesson did not cover, I will consult Google.
